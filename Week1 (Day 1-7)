DAY1:

OvertheWire Bandit challenges 1-20:

sudo su root to give root privileges

//ssh
ssh bandit01@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ssh bandit01@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme //u can type like this also if it doesnt allow u to login but u want to access stuff
exit to exit from ssh
ctrl + c to terminate process

//basic commands
ls, cat, cd, cat ./-, cat 'file with spaces in name', ls -a
find -readable -nc -owner bandit6 -group bandit7
cp and mv to copy and move files
echo is to print 

//piping
cat data.txt | grep "millionth" >> newfile.txt  //output is redirected to newfile
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
strings data.txt | grep ===  //for human readable form strings is used

//decoding basics
cat data.txt base64 -d //base64 decoding  -e =>encoding
alias rot13="tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'"
cat data.txt | rot13

//scp, netcat and ssl
scp->to transfer data over ssh
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .   
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  //to login using private ssh key into ssh
chmod 700 sshkey.private makes sure onli users have permission
ls -l filename tells abt permissions

//netcat
netcat or nc is used to read or write data over a network
nc localhost 30000

//ssl
ssl is for secure communication over networks
echo JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1 | openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect localhost:31790

//port scanning
nmap: to see which ports are open by default scans top 1000 ports
nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000
-p is which port or range -sV is for version and service detection -p- -A is to scan all ports 
will take time..here we are finding which ssl port can send back password

//difference in two files
diff file1 file2


DAY2:

Revised concepts that I had learnt in TCM Security PEH course:

Networking, addresses, OSI Model, protocols, Subnetting
Intro to python: basic printing, variables, functions, operators and expressions, list, tuple, dictionaries, loops, importing modules
Sockets, building basic port scanner
Basic Linux commands: sudo, mmkdir, rmdir, cd, ls, echo, cp, rm, mv, users and privileges, changing permissions, network commands, 
cat, nano, installing and updating tools
Bash scripting very basic program
5 stages of Ethical Hacking: Info gathering, Scanning and Enumeration, Exploitation, Maintaining Access, Covering Tracks

//Info Gathering steps:
Passive Reconnaissance Overview
Identifying Target
Discovering emails
Gathering Breached Credentials
Hunting Breached Credentials with Dehashed
Hunting Subdomains
Identifying website tech



DAY3:

//netcat
netcat or nc 
-l is needed to create a listener on server
-p to speify port 
& operator to run command in background
-n to avoid new line stuff
echo -n 'GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j' | nc -l -p 1234 & //this sends the passwd to listener on localhost port 1234 and it compares with passwd of prev lvl ,
if right it send new passwd ..  type.. ./suconnect 1234

//cron
cron is a time based job scheduler that executes commands at regular intervals chack config in /etc/cron.d
ls -la /etc/cron.d
go to bandit 22 bash script open it using cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh and execute those commands

//cron
bash files end with .sh and are always stored in /usr/bin/filename
mktemp -d makes temporary directory

stuck!:( in level 24

PicoCTFs-completed 7 basic challenges mostly general track 
//downloading n checking file types
wget http link to get files from net
./filename -h if it is 64 bit elf executable file no need to to do cat also ull find file type when u do file filename command

//Stegenography:
file filename to check extension
binwalk filename to check if hidden files are there
strings cat.jpg | grep picoCTF{* to check if that thing is present in file
hexdump -C cat.jpg gives content in hexadecimal format
echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d //does base 64 encoding
identify -verbose image.png , exif cat.jpg
install imagemagick and exif tools
use hexidor like hexer to convert hexadecimal data to text and then decode the text

//decoding using a script in python
python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en
and then enter password to decode flag using python script

strings static | grep pico //extracts and separates strings and human readable data from binary data

//hexadecimal to ascii : echo 0x70 | xxd -r
//pdf to txt
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
pdftotext hp-manual.pdf hp-manual.txt


DAY4 :
Completed 26 general challenges in picoCTF

DAY5:

Learn about OSINT[Open Source Intelligence]:
gathering publicly available sources of information about a particular target an attacker
Without actively engaging the target, the attacker can use the intelligence produced to build a threat model and develop a plan of attack.
did course from Basel Institute of Governance

DAY6:

Learnt Bash Scripting
Bash is a scripting language that runs within the terminal on most Linux distros
Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file, combined together to achieve more complex tasks than simple one-liner and 
are especially useful when it comes to automating sysadmin tasks such as backups
#!/bin/bash
echo to print
u can run normal linux commands also
Chmod +x yourfile.sh //to give permission to execute
run it using ./filename.sh
# to write commands

to use variables:
name="jammy" //no spaces b/w =
echo $jammy

bash -x ./file.sh  //to debug..if line precedes with + it is right else if - it has error
insert set -x into your script and set +x to debug a part of it

parameters:
name=$1
echo $name ..outputs first parameter ..if $2..outputs 2nd parameter
read name..echo $name
$0 gives filename, $# gives no of arguements

arrays:
transport=('car' 'train' 'bike' 'bus')
echo "${transport[@]}" //all ele
echo "${transport[1]}"
unset transport[1]   //to change or delete an element
transport[1]='trainride'

conditionals:
count=10
if [ count -eq 10 ]     //-eq is equal you can use norml = also
then                      -gt is greater than ..like that to check conditions
echo "equal to 10"        -ne is not equal to
else
echo "nope"
fi

to read and write files:   //-f to chk if file exists, -w to check if it is writabel, -r to check it it is readable
if [ -f "filename" ] && [ -w "filename" ]
then
echo "hello" > $filename
else
touch "$filename"
echo "hello" > $filename
fi

some more linux xD:
ps to see processes running(shows only system processes)
ps aux to see user processes also
top to get realtime statistics  
kill 1337 ..kills that particular process
echo "hi thm" & //makes this process run in bg or use ctrl+z to do it
fg to get it to foreground
systemctl stop myservice  //to start n stop services on booting
systemctl start myservice

Regular Expressions:
Regular expressions (or Regex) are patterns of text that you define to search documents and match exactly what you're looking for
egrep <pattern> <file> ..to search regexp pattern in a file
[abc] will match a, b, and c (every occurrence of each letter) or [a-c]zz
[abc]zz will match azz, bzz, and czz.
[a-cx-z]zz will match azz, bzz, czz, xzz, yzz, and zzz. //combining ranges
[^k]ing will match ring, sing, $ing, but not king.
[^a-c]at will match fat and hat, but not bat or cat.

a.c //. can be any char
actual dot hudukbekandre use a\.c  //only searches for a.c
cats? andre s may or may not be present cat, cats both are shown

\d matches a digit, like 9
\D matches a non-digit, like A or @
\w matches an alphanumeric character, like a or 3
\W matches a non-alphanumeric character, like ! or #
\s matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)
\S matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)

{12} - exactly 12 times.
{1,5} - 1 to 5 times.
{2,} - 2 or more times.
* - 0 or more times.
+ - 1 or more times.

^ - starts with
$ - ends with
I use (nano|vim) ..or operator

DAY7:

Learnt about Cyber Kill Chain: how attackers move through networks to identify vulnerabilities that they can then exploit
7 stage process: 
1.Reconnaissance:identifying potential targets,vulnerabilities, discovering which third parties are connected to them 
(and what data they can access), and exploring existing entry points as well as finding new ones before going to attck
2.Weaponization: creating new types of malware or modifying existing tools to use in a cyberattack
3.Delivery: infiltrate a target’s network and reach users by phishing or taking advantage of h/w and s/w vulnerabilities
4.Exploitation: further infiltrate a target’s network and achieve their objectives, move laterally
5.Installation: of malvware or cyber kill tool through backdoors, Trojan horse or CLI
6.Command and Control(C2): communicate with the malware they’ve installed onto a target’s network to instruct cyberweapons or tools to carry
out their objectives
7.Actions on Objectives: carrying out their cyberattack objectives like weaponizing a botnet to interrupt services with a Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attack, distributing malware to steal sensitive data from a target organization, and using ransomware as a cyber extortion tool


Some basic terms:
-backdoor is any sort of method which allows any organization, hacker, or even government to access your system without your permission
-Firewalls carefully analyze incoming traffic based on pre-established rules and filter traffic coming from unsecured or suspicious sources to 
prevent attacks. Firewalls guard traffic at a computer’s entry point, called ports, which is where information is exchanged with external devices.
-Trojan
-A firewall is a security network designed to protect computer systems and networks from malicious attacks.
-Antivirus is is a software utility program designed to protect a system from internal attacks from viruses, trojan horse, spyware, cannot check read-only files

-virus: computer program that connect itself to another software or computer program to harm computer system, can replicate, not controlled by remote, executed via 
executable files, main purpose to modify info, spreads at moderate rate
-worms: Worms replicate itself to cause slow down the computer system., can replicate, controlled by remote, executed via 
weaknesses in system, main purpose to eat system resources and slow down system, spreads at fast rate
-trojan: rather than replicate capture some important information about a computer system or a computer network, can't replicate, controlled by remote, 
executes through a program and interprets as utility software, main purpose to steal info, spreads at slow rate
