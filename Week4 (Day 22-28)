Day 22:[03-12-2022]

Completed boiler ctf on tryhackme :)) xDD
did enumeration, and basic exploitation, command injection vuln and changed permissions n did priv esc.

Completed Agent sudo another ctf on tryhackme
in this i learnt to crack ftp password using hydra, change useragent n try to view site using burpsuite, mget to download all files, exiftool, binwalk, steghide
xxd cutie.png to convert img to hexdummp
binwalk -e cutie.png to extract
zip2john 8702.zip > hash.txt, john hash.txt, 7z e 8702.zip
steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg
sudo scp james@<target ip>:Alien_autospy.jpg ~/ ...to copy img frm ssh to device, rev img search
sudo -l to see wht priv a user has
then google to find cve 
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash..then go to root directory n find flag!!!xp
hacking is fun ..hehe

Did LazyAdmin room on thm ..need to learn exploitation, rev shell n priv esc properly

Day 23:[04-12-2022]
Spiking:take a cmd eg: stats n do buffer overflow if sys crashes it means tht is vulnerable
enter cmds in vuln server
fuzzing:sending a bunch of char to a cmd n try to brk it..in spiking u do it to multiple cmds simultaneously in fuzzing its one particular cmd like trunk
some script n module ull hav to import
Finding offset: looking for where to write eip
patterncreate already existing tool for this by metasploit
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 3000
overwrite eip ahhh idk im not understanding anything
this is some buffer overflow stuff nthng makes sense all mpmc bullshit
learn buffer overflow properly someday lol

Active directory:(imp ante)..used in many companies for identity mgmt
activ direc: like a phonebook storung info like objects like comp, user, printer ..used by windows, directory is called services
eg: login ge u need username pswd in diff places same ones are used ..u can authenticate arnd network using kerberos
components of AD:physical:domain controller:head of all servers,hosts phonebook, has all info, provides auth,
                          data store: contains pswd, hashed, ntds.dit file, accessible onli thr dom controller processes
                       
                  logical:AD schema: rulesbook, def of all objects
                          domains: to gp n manage objects in organisation
                          tree:gp of domains, forest: collection of trees
                          trusts, objects
                          
 Web application revisited: some more extra tools using Go language
 used to use sublister to find subdomains..now u can use assetfinder
 assetfinder domain name like assetfinder --subs-only tesla.com 
 gedit run.sh
 create a bash script to store it into a particular file in a directory
 
 Day 24:[05-12-22]
 to strt service in linu: sudo service apache2 start/stop
 sudo systemctl disable ssh
 Wireless pentest: assesment of wireless network..learn frm blogposts
 WPA2 PSK(pre share key):normal manedu..with passwd
 WPA2 enterprise: credentials, more advanced environment
 we'll do psk one: 
 activities performed:eval strength of psk,reviewing nearby networks,assessing guest networks,chking network access
 tools used:wireless card-to injcet n listen to pkts,router not connected to net, laptop connected to router
 watch tht video in peh to see live wifi hacking..first connect device, find bssid of n/w, use wordlists n aircrack-ng to hack the passwd
 process: place card into monitor mode,discover channel,bssid abt network,select n/w n capture data,perform deauth attack,capture wpa handshake,
 attempt to crk handshake
 
 extra enumeration tools:
 amass-finding subdomains, go tool
 httprobe to find alive domains..cat filename | httprobe -s -p https:443 =>port 443 li yavdella active ide antha ur chking
 GoWitness to screenshot websites..gowitness single https://tesla.com
 
 https://github.com/thatonetester/sumrecon
 https://pastebin.com/MhE6zXVt.. these two to automate enumeration process
