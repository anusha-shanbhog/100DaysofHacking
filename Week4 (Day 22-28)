Day 22:[03-12-2022]

Completed boiler ctf on tryhackme :)) xDD
did enumeration, and basic exploitation, command injection vuln and changed permissions n did priv esc.

Completed Agent sudo another ctf on tryhackme
in this i learnt to crack ftp password using hydra, change useragent n try to view site using burpsuite, mget to download all files, exiftool, binwalk, steghide
xxd cutie.png to convert img to hexdummp
binwalk -e cutie.png to extract
zip2john 8702.zip > hash.txt, john hash.txt, 7z e 8702.zip
steghide extract -sf cute-alien.jpg
sudo scp james@<target ip>:Alien_autospy.jpg ~/ ...to copy img frm ssh to device, rev img search
sudo -l to see wht priv a user has
then google to find cve 
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash..then go to root directory n find flag!!!xp
hacking is fun ..hehe

Did LazyAdmin room on thm ..need to learn exploitation, rev shell n priv esc properly

Day 23:[04-12-2022]
Spiking:take a cmd eg: stats n do buffer overflow if sys crashes it means tht is vulnerable
enter cmds in vuln server
fuzzing:sending a bunch of char to a cmd n try to brk it..in spiking u do it to multiple cmds simultaneously in fuzzing its one particular cmd like trunk
some script n module ull hav to import
Finding offset: looking for where to write eip
patterncreate already existing tool for this by metasploit
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 3000
overwrite eip ahhh idk im not understanding anything
this is some buffer overflow stuff nthng makes sense all mpmc bullshit
learn buffer overflow properly someday lol

Active directory:(imp ante)..used in many companies for identity mgmt
activ direc: like a phonebook storung info like objects like comp, user, printer ..used by windows, directory is called services
eg: login ge u need username pswd in diff places same ones are used ..u can authenticate arnd network using kerberos
components of AD:physical:domain controller:head of all servers,hosts phonebook, has all info, provides auth,
                          data store: contains pswd, hashed, ntds.dit file, accessible onli thr dom controller processes
                       
                  logical:AD schema: rulesbook, def of all objects
                          domains: to gp n manage objects in organisation
                          tree:gp of domains, forest: collection of trees
                          trusts, objects
                          
 Web application revisited: some more extra tools using Go language
 used to use sublister to find subdomains..now u can use assetfinder
 assetfinder domain name like assetfinder --subs-only tesla.com 
 gedit run.sh
 create a bash script to store it into a particular file in a directory
 
 Day 24:[05-12-22]
 to strt service in linu: sudo service apache2 start/stop
 sudo systemctl disable ssh
 Wireless pentest: assesment of wireless network..learn frm blogposts
 WPA2 PSK(pre share key):normal manedu..with passwd
 WPA2 enterprise: credentials, more advanced environment
 we'll do psk one: 
 activities performed:eval strength of psk,reviewing nearby networks,assessing guest networks,chking network access
 tools used:wireless card-to injcet n listen to pkts,router not connected to net, laptop connected to router
 watch tht video in peh to see live wifi hacking..first connect device, find bssid of n/w, use wordlists n aircrack-ng to hack the passwd
 process: place card into monitor mode,discover channel,bssid abt network,select n/w n capture data,perform deauth attack,capture wpa handshake,
 attempt to crk handshake
 
 extra enumeration tools:
 amass-finding subdomains, go tool
 httprobe to find alive domains..cat filename | httprobe -s -p https:443 =>port 443 li yavdella active ide antha ur chking
 GoWitness to screenshot websites..gowitness single https://tesla.com
 
 https://github.com/thatonetester/sumrecon
 https://pastebin.com/MhE6zXVt.. these two to automate enumeration process

 Doing advent of cyber day5
 Remote Access Services:
 SSH stands for Secure Shell. It was initially used in Unix-like systems for remote login. It provides the user with a command-line interface 
 (CLI) that can be used to execute commands.

 RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol; it is also known as Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) or simply Remote Desktop (RD). 
 It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to access an MS Windows system.
 When using Remote Desktop, the user can see their desktop and use the keyboard and mouse as if sitting at the computer.

 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It provides access to a graphical interface which allows the user to view the desktop and (optionally)
 control the mouse and keyboard. VNC is available for any system with a graphical interface, including MS Windows, Linux, and even macOS, Android and Raspberry Pi.

 Authentication refers to the process where a system validates your identity.
 Password attacks:Shoulder Surfing,Password Guessing,Dictionary Attack,Brute Force Attack
 hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.2.131 ..mark is username bruteforce attack
 You can replace ssh with another protocol name, such as rdp, vnc, ftp, pop3 or any other protocol supported by Hydra.
 
 using Remmina to connect to VNC server..in vnc no username
 
 OWASP TOP 10:
 Lezgooo
 1.Injection attack:These flaws occur because user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application.
 SQL Injection: This occurs when user controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate
 the outcome of such queries. 
 Command Injection: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker is able to execute arbitrary system commands
 Defence: Allow list[allowing onli safe input by comparing with set of char], Stripping input[dangerous char r removed frm input bfor processing]
 Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a system call on the hosting machine.  It is a web vulnerability that allows an\
 attacker to take advantage of that made system call to execute operating system commands on the server. 
 on application servers.
 ;nc -e /bin/bash to do reverse shell
 
 2.Broken Authentication:
 Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users
 Strong passwd, strong session cookies that cant be predictable, brute force attacks
 defence:strong passwd, automatic lockout after certain no of attempts,multi factor authentication
 eg:register with same username like admin again n view everything with username n passwd by logging in
 
 3.Sensitive data exposure:This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information, etc),
 but could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords.Also includes man in the middle attacks where attacker would force user
 connections through a device which they control, then take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to gain access to the intercepted information
 flat-file database:db stored in file in sys instead of servers to reduce storage size but it can be accessed n hacked n sensitive ifo can be exposed eg:sqlite db
 sqlite3 <database-name>, .tables, .help, PRAGMA table_info(customers); , SELECT * FROM customers; 
 do this to find db, see usernames n passwds and login after cracking hashes
 
 4.XML External Entity:
