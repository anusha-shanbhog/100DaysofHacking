netcat or nc 
-l is needed to create a listener on server
-p to speify port

cron is a time based job scheduler that executes commands at regular intervals chack config in /etc/cron.d
ls -la /etc/cron.d
go to bandit 22 bash script open it using cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh and execute those commands

PicoCTFs
wget http link to get files from net
./filename -h works sometimes instead of doing cat

file filename to check extension
binwalk filename to check if hidden files are there
strings cat.jpg | grep picoCTF{* to check if that thing is present in file
hexdump -C cat.jpg gives content in hexadecimal format
echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d //does base 64 encoding
