Wireshark is an open-source, cross-platform network packet analyser tool capable of sniffing and investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP)
It only allows analysts to discover and investigate the packets in depth.
go to statistics, capture file data to see details abt pcap file
double click on packet to see osi model details
u can navigate to packets, mark/colour/comment them, export certain objects/packets, view in time format, filter packets, follow stream, extract 
certain files and analyze them! :)
